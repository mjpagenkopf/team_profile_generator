# Team Profile Generator

## Description -

This application allows a manager to create a simple profile page for their team and generate individual profile cards for each team member. I built this app so managers can showcase employees in a professional layout that is easy to control as each profile is created. It eliminates any concerns a manager may have about keeping the profiles consistent in style without concern for complicated code issues. I learned more about how the testing system with jest is set up. I also learned more about controlling the directory with node and separation of concerns. This is still a confusing area of programming so it will take a lot more practice.
